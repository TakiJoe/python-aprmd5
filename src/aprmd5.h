// If this is defined, PyArg_ParseTuple() will use Py_ssize_t rather than int
// when it encounters the format string "s#".
// As per Python docs: "It is best to always define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN" because
// in some future version of Python, support for int will be dropped completely.
#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN

// As per Python docs: This must be included before any standard headers are
// included.
#include <Python.h>

// The filename of the header that we include depends on the version of
// libaprutil that we want to use, and the platform we are on. We want the C
// sources to remain independent, so we use a preprocessor macro and delegate
// responsibility for defining the macro to the build process. The usual place
// where the macro is defined is setup.py.
