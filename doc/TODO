Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains a list of minor features and technical stuff that should
be implemented when time permits it. The TODO list is updated frequently as new
ideas crop up during programming.

For a broader view of how the project will develop over time, you should see
the Roadmap document.


Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
None


Priority 2 (nice to have)
-------------------------
- [#1] setup.py should auto-detect the platform that it is running on, i.e. it
  should not be necessary to manually edit setup.py to make platform-specific
  changes (autoconf?). This is partially implemented for Mac OS X and Debian,
  but not for Windows, and other versions of libaprutil are also not detected.


Priority 3 (not important)
-------------------------
- Configure Pydev project so that the extension build and the subsequent unit
  tests can be run from within Eclipse
- Configure Pydev project so that the built extension (src/packages/aprmd5.so)
  is added to the project's PYTHONPATH and the unit test modules no longer
  appear with unresolved imports within Eclipse
