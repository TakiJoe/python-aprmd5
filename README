Introduction
------------
The python-aprmd5 project provides the Python module "aprmd5", which in turn is
an interface to the MD5 routines of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Utility
Library (libaprutil).

The libaprutil MD5 routines are used to generate salted crypt-style hashes using
a version of the MD5 hash algorithm modified for Apache. The resulting hashes
always start with the prefix characters "$apr1$" in order to distinguish them
from the result of various other crypt() variants, which use other prefixes.
For instance, for input "foo" and salt "mYJd83wW", libaprutil produces the
following hash:

  $apr1$mYJd83wW$IO.6aK3G0d4mHxcImhPX50

Hashes like this are typically generated by the command line utility htpasswd,
which is part of the Apache HTTP server project. The hashes encrypt user
passwords, which are used by the Apache HTTP server for basic user
authentication.


Release notes
-------------
This is python-aprmd5 0.1 (the initial release of the project).

For more details see the ChangeLog document.


License and source code
-----------------------
python-aprmd5 is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3). You
should have received a copy of the license along with the python-aprmd5 module
distribution (see the file COPYING inside the distribution). If not, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The source code for python-aprmd5 can be downloaded from its website
http://www.herzbube.ch/python-aprmd5/. The source files are packaged into a tar
ball using the Distutils Python module. Alternatively you may also get the
source code (including project files to hack python-aprmd5 in Eclipse) from this
git respository: http://herzbube.ch/git/python-aprmd5/


Dependencies
------------
Obviously, python-aprmd5 depends on the presence of libaprutil. At compile time,
both the headers and the library file must be present. At runtime, the library
file is sufficient.

No formal tests for compatibility with certain versions of libaprutil have been
performed. The earliest version that I have casually used on my system at home
is libaprutil 0.9. 


Python versions
---------------
The minimum requirement for running a current version of python-aprmd5 is
Python 2.6 (tests were made with Python 2.6.2). It should also run fine with
Python 3.


Limitations
-----------
None known.
